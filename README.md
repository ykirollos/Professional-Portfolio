## Purpose
In this Assignment, I put to use what I've learned so far in CSS, mainly flex and hover.
The page consists of a name flag and a quick link bar in the header, then About me, followed by my work sample, and finally my contact info.
It was very tricky ligning up all the items and making the page look as closely as possible to the Read-me Mock-up.
I am getting more confident creating content in CSS
